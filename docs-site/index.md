# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nandemo-ya/kecs.git
cd kecs

# Build and run
make build
./bin/kecs server

```

## Why KECS?

KECS provides a fully local ECS-compatible environment that operates independently of AWS. Perfect for:

- **Local Development**: Test ECS workloads without AWS costs
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Run integration tests in isolated environments
- **Learning**: Understand ECS concepts without AWS account
- **Offline Development**: Work on ECS applications without internet

## Architecture Overview

KECS implements the ECS API specification on top of Kubernetes:

- **Control Plane**: Handles ECS API requests and manages state
- **Storage Layer**: DuckDB for persistent storage
- **Kubernetes Backend**: Translates ECS concepts to Kubernetes resources
