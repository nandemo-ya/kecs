# E2E Test Report: Single Task Nginx
Date: 2025-07-28
KECS Instance: test-nginx-e2e

## Test Summary
- **Status**: PASS
- **Duration**: ~8 minutes
- **Tested Example**: /Users/stormcat/go/src/github.com/nandemo-ya/kecs/examples/single-task-nginx
- **KECS Image Tag**: 68e653a
- **Key Finding**: Issue #407 is FIXED - Task status correctly shows as RUNNING when pod containers are running

## Test Execution Details

### 1. Environment Setup
- Created qa-results directory for test artifacts
- Started KECS instance on port 8090 (port 8080 was occupied)
- Configured AWS CLI with endpoint URL and region us-east-1
- KECS started successfully with all components (Control Plane, LocalStack, Traefik Gateway)

### 2. Deployment Phase

#### Cluster Creation
```json
{
    "cluster": {
        "clusterArn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:000000000000:cluster/default",
        "clusterName": "default",
        "status": "ACTIVE"
    }
}
```

#### Task Definition Registration
```json
{
    "taskDefinition": {
        "taskDefinitionArn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:000000000000:task-definition/single-task-nginx:1",
        "family": "single-task-nginx",
        "revision": 1,
        "status": "ACTIVE",
        "networkMode": "awsvpc",
        "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
        "cpu": "256",
        "memory": "512"
    }
}
```

#### Service Creation
```json
{
    "service": {
        "serviceArn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:000000000000:service/default/single-task-nginx",
        "serviceName": "single-task-nginx",
        "status": "PROVISIONING",
        "desiredCount": 1,
        "runningCount": 0,
        "pendingCount": 1
    }
}
```

### 3. Verification Results

#### Task Status Monitoring
The task was created and transitioned to RUNNING status correctly:
```json
{
    "taskArn": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:000000000000:task/default-us-east-1/ecs-service-single-task-nginx-6b48b86448-vjqbg",
    "lastStatus": "RUNNING",
    "desiredStatus": "RUNNING",
    "containers": [{
        "lastStatus": "RUNNING",
        "name": "nginx",
        "image": "nginx:latest"
    }]
}
```

**Critical Finding**: The task status remained consistently RUNNING across multiple checks over 25 seconds, confirming Issue #407 is fixed.

#### Kubernetes Pod Status
The underlying Kubernetes pod was verified to be running:
```
NAME                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ecs-service-single-task-nginx-6b48b86448-vjqbg   1/1     Running   0          2m10s
```

Pod details showed successful container startup:
- Container ID: containerd://cc1a430909add8ae52bba1f272316337df2c42c544bb684264f75f92d83d60d4
- Image: nginx:latest
- State: Running
- Started: 2025-07-28 16:44:11 +0900
- Ready: True

#### Service Status
Final service status showed healthy deployment:
```json
{
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "desiredCount": 1,
    "runningCount": 1,
    "pendingCount": 0
}
```

### 4. Application Testing
Nginx server was successfully tested through port-forwarding:
- Port forward established: localhost:8888 -> pod:80
- HTTP GET request returned the default nginx welcome page
- Response confirmed the web server was functioning correctly

### 5. Issues Found
None. The deployment worked flawlessly with no errors or unexpected behaviors.

### 6. Cleanup Status
- Service deleted successfully (status changed to INACTIVE)
- KECS instance stopped cleanly
- All resources cleaned up properly

## Recommendations

1. **Issue #407 Resolution Confirmed**: The KECS image tag 68e653a successfully fixes the issue where task status would show as PENDING even when the pod was running. The task now correctly reflects RUNNING status when containers are active.

2. **Namespace Usage**: KECS creates tasks in a namespace following the pattern `{cluster-name}-{region}` (e.g., default-us-east-1). This should be documented for users who need to interact with the underlying Kubernetes resources.

3. **Performance**: The task startup time was quick (~9 seconds from creation to RUNNING status), indicating good performance.

4. **Stability**: The task status remained stable throughout the test period with no flapping between states.

## Conclusion

The single-task-nginx example successfully demonstrates KECS's ability to run ECS workloads on Kubernetes. The test confirms that Issue #407 has been resolved in KECS image tag 68e653a, with task statuses now accurately reflecting the underlying container state.
