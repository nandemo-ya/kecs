# Phase 3: Task Lifecycle & Status - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Phase 3 of the KECS scenario tests focuses on task lifecycle management and status tracking. This phase validates that KECS correctly manages task execution, monitors status transitions, and handles various task lifecycle scenarios.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Task Status Checker Utility (`utils/task_status_checker.go`)

A comprehensive utility for tracking and validating task status transitions:

- **Status Tracking**: Records complete history of task status changes
- **Transition Validation**: Ensures status transitions follow valid ECS patterns
- **Wait Functions**: Provides flexible waiting for specific statuses or desired states
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Monitors various lifecycle timestamps (created, started, stopped, etc.)

Key features:
- `WaitForStatus()`: Wait for a specific task status with timeout
- `WaitForDesiredStatus()`: Wait for task to reach its desired status
- `ValidateTransitions()`: Validate that status transitions follow expected patterns
- `GetStatusHistory()`: Retrieve complete status transition history

### 2. Task Operation Tests

#### RunTask Test (`task/run_task_test.go`)
Tests for the RunTask API operation:
- Simple task execution reaching RUNNING status
- Multiple task execution (count > 1)
- Task execution with environment variables
- Task execution with container overrides
- Error handling for invalid configurations

#### StopTask Test (`task/stop_task_test.go`)
Tests for the StopTask API operation:
- Stopping running tasks gracefully
- Stopping multiple tasks
- Stopping tasks without providing a reason
- Stopping tasks in PENDING state
- Error handling for invalid task/cluster combinations
- Handling already stopped tasks

#### Task Status Transitions Test (`task/task_status_transitions_test.go`)
Comprehensive testing of task status transitions:
- Normal lifecycle transitions (PROVISIONING → PENDING → RUNNING → STOPPED)
- Failure scenario transitions
- Desired status tracking and changes
- Timestamp validation and chronological ordering
- Invalid image handling

#### Task Lifecycle Test (`task/task_lifecycle_test.go`)
End-to-end task lifecycle scenarios:
- Task completion with exit code 0
- Task failure with non-zero exit codes
- Resource allocation for single and multi-container tasks
- Volume mounting and data persistence
- Network configuration and port mappings

### 3. Service Task Management Test (`service/service_tasks_test.go`)

Tests for service-managed task scenarios:
- Service launching correct number of tasks
- Automatic task replacement on failure
- Service scaling up (1 → 4 tasks)
- Service scaling down (4 → 1 task)
- Task management during service updates
- Rolling updates with new task definitions

### 4. Test Fixtures

Created reusable task definition fixtures in `fixtures/task-definitions/`:
- `busybox-sleep.json`: Simple long-running task
- `multi-container.json`: Multi-container application
- `task-with-volumes.json`: Task with volume mounts
- `failing-task.json`: Task that fails immediately

### 5. AWS ECS Client Updates

Enhanced the ECS client (`utils/aws_ecs_client.go`) with task operations:
- `RunTask()`: Execute one-off tasks
- `StopTask()`: Stop running tasks
- `DescribeTasks()`: Get detailed task information
- `ListTasks()`: List tasks with filtering options

### 6. Helper Functions

Added utility functions to `utils/test_helpers.go`:
- `InterfaceSliceToStringSlice()`: Type conversion helper
- `GenerateRandomString()`: Random string generation for unique names

### 7. Makefile Updates

Added Phase 3 test targets:
- `test-phase3`: Run all Phase 3 tests
- `test-task`: Run only task-specific tests

## Test Coverage

Phase 3 provides comprehensive coverage of:

1. **Task Execution**
   - Single and multiple task runs
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Container overrides
   - Resource specifications

2. **Status Management**
   - All valid status transitions
   - Failure scenarios
   - Desired vs actual status tracking
   - Status history validation

3. **Lifecycle Events**
   - Task startup and initialization
   - Normal completion
   - Failure handling
   - Forced termination

4. **Service Integration**
   - Service-managed task lifecycle
   - Automatic replacement
   - Scaling operations
   - Rolling updates

## Running Phase 3 Tests

```bash
# Run all Phase 3 tests
make test-phase3

# Run only task tests
make test-task

# Run specific test
make test-one TEST="RunTask"

# Run with verbose output
make test-verbose
```

## Key Validations

1. **Status Transition Patterns**
   - PROVISIONING → PENDING → RUNNING → STOPPED (normal flow)
   - Proper handling of intermediate states
   - Validation of transition ordering

2. **Resource Management**
   - CPU and memory allocation
   - Volume mounting
   - Network configuration

3. **Error Scenarios**
   - Invalid task definitions
   - Non-existent clusters
   - Image pull failures
   - Container exit codes

4. **Service Behaviors**
   - Maintaining desired count
   - Task replacement on failure
   - Graceful scaling operations

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, the foundation for task lifecycle management testing is established. Future phases can build upon this to test:
- Advanced service operations (Phase 4)
- Failure scenarios and recovery (Phase 5)
- Integration with deployment tools (Phase 6)
- Performance and scale testing (Phase 7)
