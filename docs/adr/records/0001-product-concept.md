# Product Concept: KECS (Kubernetes-based ECS Compatible Service)

## Product Name

KECS (Kubernetes-based ECS Compatible Service)

**Date:** 2025-05-13

## Status

Draft

## Executive Summary

KECS is a standalone, AWS-independent implementation of the Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) API that runs on Kubernetes. It provides a fully compatible ECS API interface while operating entirely locally, enabling developers to build, test, and validate ECS-based applications without requiring an AWS account or infrastructure. By leveraging Kubernetes as the underlying container orchestration system, KECS delivers a familiar ECS experience that can run anywhere Kubernetes can - from local development environments to CI/CD pipelines.

## Problem Statement

Amazon ECS is a widely-used container orchestration service, but it presents significant challenges for local development and testing. As an AWS-specific service with its control plane firmly in the AWS cloud, developers face difficulties when trying to:

1. Develop and test ECS-based applications locally without incurring AWS costs
2. Run integration tests in CI/CD environments that require ECS API interactions
3. Validate ECS deployment configurations without deploying to actual AWS infrastructure
4. Learn and experiment with ECS APIs in a safe, controlled environment
5. Develop operational tools that interact with ECS APIs

These limitations slow down development cycles, increase costs, and create friction in the development process for teams using Amazon ECS.

## Target Users

Primary users:
- Software developers building applications that interact with ECS APIs
- DevOps engineers developing operational tools for ECS environments
- QA engineers testing applications that depend on ECS functionality
- CI/CD pipeline architects implementing automated testing for ECS workloads

Secondary users:
- Cloud architects evaluating ECS for potential adoption
- Educators teaching container orchestration concepts
- Organizations looking to reduce AWS costs during development and testing

## Value Proposition

KECS provides unique value through:

1. **AWS Independence**: Run a fully compatible ECS environment without any AWS dependencies
2. **Local Development**: Develop and test against ECS APIs entirely on local machines
3. **CI/CD Compatibility**: Enable ECS testing in any CI environment, including GitHub Actions
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminate AWS costs for development and testing environments
5. **Learning Platform**: Provide a safe environment to learn and experiment with ECS APIs
6. **Kubernetes Foundation**: Leverage the stability and portability of Kubernetes while maintaining ECS compatibility

Unlike ECS Anywhere, which still requires an AWS control plane, KECS operates completely independently of AWS while maintaining API compatibility.

## Key Features

1. **ECS API Compatibility**: Implement the core ECS API endpoints with behavior matching the actual AWS service
2. **Kubernetes Backend**: Use Kubernetes as the underlying container orchestration system
3. **Local Execution**: Run completely standalone on a local machine using tools like kind or minikube
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
5. **Task Definition Support**: Process and execute ECS task definitions with high fidelity
6. **Service Management**: Support ECS service definitions, including scaling and load balancing concepts
7. **Container Instance Emulation**: Emulate ECS container instances and the ECS agent
8. **CLI Compatibility**: Work with existing ECS CLI tools through API compatibility

## Success Metrics

1. **API Compatibility**: 95%+ functional compatibility with core ECS APIs
2. **Performance**: Startup time under 2 minutes on a standard development machine
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Run with less than 4GB RAM overhead on a local system
4. **User Adoption**: Active community of users and contributors
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite validating compatibility with real ECS behavior
6. **Documentation Quality**: Clear, comprehensive documentation for all supported features

## Constraints and Considerations

1. **API Scope**: Not all ECS APIs may be implemented initially; focus will be on the most commonly used endpoints
2. **Performance Differences**: Local execution may have different performance characteristics than actual AWS ECS
3. **Feature Parity**: AWS regularly adds features to ECS; maintaining parity will require ongoing effort
4. **Security Model**: The security model will differ from AWS IAM but should provide analogous capabilities
5. **Kubernetes Dependency**: Users will need basic Kubernetes knowledge or tooling (kind, minikube) installed
6. **AWS Feature Gaps**: Some AWS-specific integrations (like CloudWatch) may be simulated or have limited functionality

## Timeline and Milestones

High-level timeline for development and release:

- Milestone 1: Core API implementation and basic task execution (3 months)
- Milestone 2: Service management and scaling capabilities (3 months)
- Milestone 3: Advanced features and comprehensive documentation (2 months)
- Release 1.0: Production-ready release with stable API (8 months total)

## Open Questions

1. Which specific ECS API endpoints should be prioritized for the initial implementation?
2. How closely should we emulate AWS-specific integrations like CloudWatch logs?
3. Should we implement a simplified IAM-like permission system?
4. What is the best approach for handling ECS task networking in a Kubernetes environment?
5. How will we handle version compatibility as AWS updates the ECS API?
6. Should we consider implementing any AWS Fargate compatibility?
