# TUI API Integration - Phase 1 Complete

This document summarizes the completion of Phase 1 of the TUI backend integration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. API Data Types (`internal/tui/api/types.go`)
- Defined all core data structures for TUI-API communication
- Instance, Cluster, Service, Task structures
- ECS API request/response types
- Error handling structures

### 2. API Interface (`internal/tui/api/interface.go`)
- Created comprehensive Client interface for all KECS operations
- Instance operations: List, Get, Create, Delete, GetLogs
- ECS operations: Clusters, Services, Tasks, Task Definitions
- Health check endpoint
- Streaming interface for real-time updates (future phase)

### 3. HTTP Client Implementation (`internal/tui/api/client.go`)
- Full HTTP client implementing the Client interface
- Proper error handling and JSON marshaling
- Timeout configuration
- RESTful endpoint structure

### 4. Mock Client (`internal/tui/api/mock_client.go`)
- Complete mock implementation for testing
- Realistic mock data for all resources
- Simulates async operations (instance creation)
- In-memory state management

### 5. TUI Integration
- Updated Model to include API client
- Created configuration system for switching between mock/real API
- Updated instance creation to use API client
- Added proper message handling for API responses
- Environment variable configuration:
  - `KECS_API_ENDPOINT`: Set API endpoint (defaults to http://localhost:8080)
  - `KECS_TUI_MOCK`: Force mock mode even with endpoint set

### 6. Commands Integration (`internal/tui/commands.go`)
- Refactored data loading to use API client
- Proper data transformation from API types to TUI types
- Context-based cancellation for API calls
- Error handling and reporting

## How to Use

### Running with Mock Data (Default)
```bash
# Just run the TUI normally
./bin/kecs
```

### Running with Real API
```bash
# Set the API endpoint
export KECS_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080
./bin/kecs
```

### Forcing Mock Mode
```bash
# Force mock mode even with API endpoint set
export KECS_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080
export KECS_TUI_MOCK=true
./bin/kecs
```

## Architecture Changes

1. **Separation of Concerns**: API client is completely separate from TUI logic
2. **Interface-based Design**: Easy to swap implementations (mock vs real)
3. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration
4. **Type Safety**: Proper type definitions for all API interactions

## What's Ready for Next Phases

- Phase 2 (Data Loading): All API methods are implemented and ready
- Phase 3 (Real-time Updates): Streaming interface defined
- Phase 4 (Command Execution): API client supports all operations
- Phase 5 (Error Handling): Basic structure in place

## Testing

The implementation can be tested immediately:
1. Mock mode works out of the box
2. Real API integration ready when backend endpoints are available
3. Instance creation already integrated with API client

## Next Steps

To proceed with Phase 2-5:
1. Backend needs to implement the API endpoints
2. WebSocket support for real-time updates
3. Enhanced error handling and retry logic
4. Loading states and progress indicators
